# Overlay

## Overview
Minimal overlay atom used to dim or block the UI behind dialogs and panels.

## Field Reference (UE Model)
- No fields.

## Runtime Behavior
- `createOverlay()` returns a `<div.overlay>` element. Styling and interaction (e.g., click-to-close) are handled by the host component.

## Authoring Notes
- Not intended for direct authoring; used programmatically by containers (e.g., dialogs).

## Defaults and Fallbacks
- None.
